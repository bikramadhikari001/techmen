Everyone's had a terrible chatbot experience. You know the one—you type a simple question and get a completely irrelevant response, then spend 10 minutes trying to reach a human.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Here's how to build chatbots that actually work.

## The Golden Rule: Know Your Limits

The best chatbots know what they don't know. Instead of confidently giving wrong answers, they gracefully hand off to humans when they're uncertain.

This requires:
- **Confidence scoring** - The bot should know when it's guessing
- **Clear escalation paths** - Make it easy to reach a human
- **Honest communication** - "I'm not sure about that, let me connect you with someone who can help"

## Start Narrow, Then Expand

Don't try to build a bot that can handle everything. Start with the top 5-10 most common questions and nail those first. You can always expand later.

A bot that handles 20% of inquiries perfectly is more valuable than one that handles 80% poorly.

## Train on Real Conversations

Generic training data produces generic bots. The magic happens when you train on your actual customer conversations:

- Historical support tickets
- Chat logs
- FAQ interactions
- Product-specific terminology

## Design for the Unhappy Path

Most chatbot demos show the happy path—everything works perfectly. But real users will:
- Ask questions in unexpected ways
- Change topics mid-conversation
- Get frustrated and type gibberish
- Try to break the bot

Design for these scenarios. Test with real users who aren't trying to be nice.

## Measure What Matters

Don't just track "conversations handled." Measure:
- **Resolution rate** - Did the customer's problem actually get solved?
- **Escalation rate** - How often do users need human help?
- **Customer satisfaction** - Do users rate the experience positively?
- **Return rate** - Do customers come back to the bot or avoid it?

## The Bottom Line

A good chatbot is like a good employee—helpful, honest about limitations, and knows when to ask for help. Build with that mindset, and you'll create something customers actually appreciate.
