Let's be honest: most AI projects fail. Studies consistently show that 70-80% of AI initiatives never make it to production. After working on dozens of AI projects, we've seen the patterns that separate success from failure.

## The Three Killers of AI Projects

### 1. Starting With Technology, Not Problems

The most common mistake? Companies decide they "need AI" before identifying what problem they're solving. They buy expensive tools, hire data scientists, and then go looking for use cases.

**What works instead:** Start with a specific, measurable business problem. "Reduce customer support response time by 50%" is a goal. "Implement AI" is not.

### 2. Underestimating Data Requirements

AI is hungry. It needs clean, relevant, accessible data—and most organizations don't have it. We've seen projects stall for months while teams try to wrangle data from legacy systems.

**What works instead:** Do a data audit before committing to any AI project. If the data doesn't exist or can't be accessed, that's your first project—not the AI.

### 3. Ignoring the Human Element

The best AI system is worthless if people don't use it. We've seen million-dollar projects gather dust because no one thought about change management, training, or workflow integration.

**What works instead:** Involve end users from day one. Build for adoption, not just accuracy.

## The Simple Framework That Works

After years of trial and error, we've developed a simple approach:

1. **Prove value fast** - Start with a focused pilot that can show ROI in weeks, not years
2. **Build trust incrementally** - Let the AI assist humans before trying to replace them
3. **Measure what matters** - Track business outcomes, not just model metrics
4. **Plan for maintenance** - AI systems need ongoing care; budget for it

## The Bottom Line

AI isn't magic. It's a tool—and like any tool, it works best when applied to the right problems by people who understand both the technology and the business context.

If you're considering an AI project, start by asking: "What specific problem are we solving, and how will we know if we've succeeded?" If you can't answer that clearly, you're not ready for AI yet.

And that's okay. Sometimes the best AI strategy is knowing when not to use it.
