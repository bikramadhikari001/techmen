In tech, there's constant pressure to use the newest, most sophisticated solutions. But after years of building systems, we've learned a counterintuitive truth: **simple beats smart, almost every time.**

## The Complexity Trap

It's tempting to reach for complex solutions. They're intellectually satisfying. They look impressive in architecture diagrams. They give engineers interesting problems to solve.

But complexity has costs:
- More things that can break
- Harder to debug when things go wrong
- Steeper learning curve for new team members
- Higher maintenance burden over time

## Real Examples

### The Over-Engineered Recommendation System

A client wanted product recommendations. The "smart" approach: build a sophisticated machine learning pipeline with real-time feature engineering, A/B testing infrastructure, and multiple model ensembles.

What we built instead: A simple rule-based system that recommended products frequently bought together. It took a week instead of three months, and it performed nearly as well.

When the simple version proved valuable, we had the option to make it smarter. But we started simple.

### The Unnecessary Microservices

Another client had a monolithic application they wanted to "modernize" with microservices. The problem? They had a team of three developers and modest traffic.

Microservices would have added:
- Network complexity
- Deployment complexity  
- Debugging complexity
- Infrastructure costs

We helped them improve their monolith instead. Faster, cheaper, and easier to maintain.

## When to Choose Complexity

Simple doesn't mean simplistic. Sometimes complexity is genuinely necessary:

- When you have proven scale requirements
- When different components need different scaling characteristics
- When you have the team to maintain it
- When simpler approaches have been tried and failed

The key word is "proven." Don't build for hypothetical scale or hypothetical requirements.

## Our Decision Framework

When evaluating solutions, we ask:

1. **What's the simplest thing that could work?**
2. **What are the actual (not imagined) requirements?**
3. **Who will maintain this in 2 years?**
4. **Can we start simple and add complexity later?**

## The Bottom Line

Boring technology is underrated. It's well-understood, well-documented, and battle-tested. Save the cutting-edge stuff for when you genuinely need it.

Simplicity first. That's not just a motto—it's our engineering philosophy.
